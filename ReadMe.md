# Sample JS App

This is a sample JS app to show off a few things like npm usage and app structure.

## What led here?

Running the following:

```bash
# everything from previous steps, plus...
# install the webpack library
~/sample-js-app > npm add -D jquery
```

- Import jQuery into `src/index.js` to make sure jQuery is working as expected.
- Now the application can be built using just jQuery and HTML/CSS.

## Available Commands

```
npm run start
```
Starts the local web server.

```
npm run build
```
Builds a set of deployable assets including a JavaScript bundle and matching index.html.
